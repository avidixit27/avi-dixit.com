### Version
I created a personal website from scratch March 2020. 
Any changes to the website and the date those occur will be updated below.


### Design
I had a logo of sorts that had me in front of a beach with my name surrounding me. I wanted to make a central intro animation around that picture.
This gave me a natural blue and tan color scheme from the sand and the water. I was limited to one page because prices for additional pages were too inconvienent.
Thus, I liked the idea of keeping everything very symmetrical and aligned as your scroll down the single page. 

The site has 3 sections:
  * Intro/Resume
  * About
  * Projects
  * Connect

Each of these sections are broken up by a color change and bars on the top and bottom.
In the future, I would like to update the design to be more aersthetically pleasing with better fluid animations. 


### Implementation
See the code for greater implementation details.
I had one HTML file that connected to one CSS file for style and one JS file for animations. I also added a few CSS animations such as enlarging photos when the user hovers over them.
