                I was born in Virginia in 2001, but at heart, I consider myself a Memphian -- a Memphis, TN native. 
                <br><br>
                In 2006 when I was 5 years old, we moved to the neighborhood we now call home. It seemed like every house in the neighborhood had a kid around my age. The youngest of my friends was 4 years old and the oldest was 10. We played together everyday in <i>The Cove</i> aptly referring to the cove we all lived around. 
                <br><br>
 	            In 2019, I graduated from White Station High School 10th in my class of 504. Upon graduation, I was met with an offer from Dartmouth College, which I enthusiastically accepted. My childhood friends had all moved away, and it was finally my turn too. 
                <br><br>
                I was passionate about being a Memphian at school, but I never imagined returning to The Cove. My aspirations lay beyond the Bluff City. I would visit a few weeks at a time, catch up with friends, and return to my new home in Hanover, NH...until March 2020. 
                <br><br>
                With a global pandemic sweeping the nation, my college swiftly returned me back to Memphis, assuring us we would return to campus soon enough. Weeks turned into months, which turned into a year. This home has now become both my childhood home and adult home, and balancing that can be frustrating, to say the least.
                <br><br>
                Today, I am a sophomore working on a major in Computer Science. My expected graduation is in June of 2023. This is not how I expected college to turn out, but I found ways to make it work. I love cars, the outdoors, and Hip-Hop music. I'm huge on adrenaline pumping activities like roller coasters, horror movies, and white water rafting. I have a dry sense of humor and can usually proffer a Spongebob reference at just the right time. 
                <br><br>
                Finally, most of all, I adore logic with creative freedom, which is why I want to be a full stack developer. This website showcases some of my skills.

                Over winter break 2020, two friends and I decided to make a productivity react web application for students. 
                <br><br>
                The website can be used with or without user authentication. If you make an account, the site is more personalized and works better each time you use it. 
                <br><br>
                The site has a short intro survey that logs your study preferences and how long it takes for you to do basic tasks. From there, you can create a to do list for the day, and the site will create a recommended schedule to follow for the day.
                <br><br>
                On the right, there are sticky notes that are saved if you make an account. On the left, there are menus that change the display of the center screen.
                <br><br>
                After your schedule is made, the site can automatically download your schedule as an Excel file. Over time, the algorithm improves to better estimate the times it takes for you to do certain tasks.
